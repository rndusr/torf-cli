2024-06-13 5.2.1
  - Exclude tests from package


2024-03-25 5.2.0
  - New option: --merge JSON: Add custom information to a torrent's metainfo or
    remove arbitrary information from it


2023-04-29 5.1.0
  - New option: --creator


2023-04-13 5.0.0
  - Include profile name (if given) in torrent file name by default


2022-12-17 4.0.4
  - Bugfix: Fix --max-piece-size


2022-07-05 4.0.3
  - Bugfix: Fix --help output: Short form of --nocreator is now -A.


2022-06-19 4.0.2
  - Bugfix: --max-piece-size was ignored with reused torrents.


2022-06-02 4.0.1
  - Bugfix: --nomagnet was ignored in info mode.
  - Include magnet link in output even if input is also a magnet link.
    Only exclude it with --nomagnet.


2022-05-05 4.0.0
  - New option: --reuse <directory or torrent file> copies piece hashes from an
    existing torrent file if it contains the same files. If given a directory,
    it is recursively searched for a matching torrent file.
  - The short flag -R for --nocreator was renamed to -A so -R can be used for
    --noreuse.
  - When verifying files against a torrent in previous versions, each file was
    only verified up to the first corrupt piece unless --verbose was given. Now
    all files are always completely verified.
  - The "Files" field in --json output is now a list of objects like this:
    {"Path": <relative file path>, "Size": <file size>}
  - Bugfix: The --max-piece-size parameter was always used as the actual piece
    size, even if it was much too large for the given content.


2021-02-20 3.4.0
  - New option: --threads


2020-08-11 3.3.0
  - Always display which tier a tracker belongs to unless the whole torrent has
    only one tracker.
  - New options: --include and --include-regex include files that match exclude
    patterns.
  - Bugfix: --exclude-regex was ignored when editing an existing torrent.


2020-06-21 3.2.0
  - Support for reading magnet URIs was added, e.g. "torf -i 'magnet:...' -o
    foo.torrent".  The missing information is downloaded from the parameters
    "xs", "as", "ws" and "tr", if possible.  Support for DHT and UDP trackers is
    not implemented.
  - The --in option now supports "-" as a parameter to read a torrent or magnet
    URI from stdin.
  - When verifying torrent content, a trailing slash in PATH automatically
    appends the torrent's name to PATH.  For example, "torf -i foo.torrent
    path/to/foo" is identical to "torf -i foo.torrent path/to/" while "torf -i
    foo.torrent path/to" looks for foo.torrent's files in "path/to".
  - --in, --out and --name are now illegal in config files.


2020-04-07 3.1.1
  - Bugfix: Allow all torf 3.*.* version, not just 3.0.0.


2020-04-02 3.1.0
  - Huge performance increase due to multithreading.
  - Verify a torrent's content: torf -i content.torrent path/to/content
  - Progress is now reported in two lines with more information.
  - New option: --metainfo prints a JSON object of the torrent's metainfo.
  - New option: --json prints a JSON object of the regular output.
  - New option: --verbose shows file sizes in plain bytes, verifies file
    content more thoroughly, etc.
  - New option: --exclude-regex excludes files that match a regular expression.
  - --exclude and --exclude-regex patterns are now matched against the complete
    relative path within the torrent instead of individual path segments.
  - Support for multiple tiers of announce URLs when creating torrents.
  - Exit codes have changed and are now properly documented in the man page.
  - Bugfix: --max-piece-size can now set piece sizes larger than 16 MiB.


2019-06-03 3.0.1
  - Fixed minor bug that caused trailing zeros to be removed from numbers, e.g.
    "10 GiB" was displayed as "1 GiB"


2019-04-04 3.0.0
  - Use proper version number scheme.
  - Fixed "--exclude requires PATH" error when editing a torrent with global
    "exclude" options in the config file.
  - New options: --source to add a "source" field to the torrent and --nosource
    to remove it from an existing torrent.
  - New option: --max-piece-size optionally limits the piece size.


2018-06-19 2.0
  - Support for default arguments and special profiles in ~/.config/torf/config
    or any file specified by --config or -f.
  - Use \e[0E instead of \e[1` to clear the line when showing progress.
    (marcelpaulo)
  - If output is not a TTY, "Progress ..." lines are not cleared but followed by
    a newline character and the rest of the line is parsable like the other
    output.
  - Long or multiline torrent file comments are now properly indented.
  - --exclude patterns are now matched against each directory/file name in a
    path instead of just the file name.
  - Torrent file and magnet link are now both created by default, and the
    --magnet option was replaced by --nomagnet and --notorrent.
  - In the output 'Magnet URI' was shortened to 'Magnet', 'Torrent File' was
    shortened to 'Torrent' and 'Creation Date' was shortened to 'Created'.
  - The default for --date was changed from 'today' to 'now'.


2018-04-08 1.1
  - Major rewrite with lots of tests that should fix the most obvious bugs
  - The options --source and --nosource have been removed
  - The option --nocreator has been added
  - Output is now easier to parse when stdout is not a TTY (e.g. when piping to
    grep, cut, awk, etc)
